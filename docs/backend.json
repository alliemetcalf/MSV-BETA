    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to store door codes associated with properties. It follows the principle of path-based ownership under each user. Each user has their own collection of door codes, enabling easy management and security rule creation. The structure prioritizes Authorization Independence, avoiding complex `get()` calls in security rules by ensuring that authorization context is directly tied to the user ID derived from authentication.  The path `/users/{userId}/door_codes/{doorCodeId}` uses hierarchical paths for user-owned data, which provides clarity and consistency, as well as makes it easy to create ownership-based security rules. This structure also facilitates secure `list` operations by scoping door codes to individual users."
